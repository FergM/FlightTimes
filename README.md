# FlightTimes (Under Construction)
Python3 code for flight punctuality comparison.

Objectives:
(1*) Pull first hand flight data from airport website(s),
(2) Collect data over time,
(3) Analyse delays by airlines, route & time of day 

Motivation:
  I regularly fly to London and have noticed that Friday evening flights are often delayed.
  Ideally this tool would help me and others to find airlines/flight times which are less delayed.

\* = currently working on this stage
